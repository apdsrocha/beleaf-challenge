> Challenge part of a selection process for a junior frontend position.

My assignment was to recreate the page located [ here ] (https://www.beleaf.com.br/pedido/pratos) to the best of my ability.

It was done over the course of one Sunday late-afternoon.

## Visualizing

After downloading the repository or cloning it, you should be able to view the project by opening the index file in your browser. Resizing the browser will give you an idea of the adjustments made for mobile versions.

## Developing

### Built With

Visual Studio Code, with Firefox as my browser for development.
